###### How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

I feel very confident. Some of the documentation for other methods gets a little more complicated, but I feel like I can work through the material myself productively.

###### Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

No, I found this exercise to be appropriate and useful.

###### What questions do you have about Arrays?

Are there limits on size for arrays (whether this limit is a best practice or a physical limit on memory)? Is there an example for when an array with multiple data types *would* be a good practice?
